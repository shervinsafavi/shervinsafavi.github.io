- title: CMC lab has just opened!
  date: 1 October 2023
  abstract: I have started my group at the Medical Campus of TU Dresden. At the Computational Machinery of Cognition (CMC) lab, we want to understand the computations that support our cognition, and also the multi-scale machinery that implements these computations. We closely collaborate with experimental and computational labs to develop new tools, computational models, and experimental paradigms to understand the computational machinery of cognition.

- title: New paper published in Neuron!
  date: 29 August 2022
  abstract: Our paper with Peter Dayan on "Multistability, Perceptual Value, and Internal Foraging" has just been published in Neuron. We propose a new framework for understanding perceptual multistability based on value-based decision-making instead of the passive Helmholtzian inference.

# - title: Design and Analysis of the NIPS 2016 Review Process Accepted at JMLR
#  date: 24 July 2018
#  abstract: In this paper, we analyze several aspects of the data collected during the review process, including an experiment investigating the efficacy of collecting ordinal rankings from reviewers (vs. usual scores aka cardinal rankings). Our goal is to check the soundness of the review process we implemented and, in going so, provide insights that may be useful in the design of the review process of subsequent conferences. We introduce a number of metrics that could be used for monitoring improvements when new ideas are introduced.
